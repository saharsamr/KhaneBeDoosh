# Khane Be Doosh!

This project is a RIA web application; base on the "Internet Engineering" course on University of Tehran.

The website is designed for sharing for-sale estates, whether you are a person or an organization. Both front-end and back-end's development has been committed. So many bugs exist because of DEADLINES!

The front-end is developed using react, and back-end at first implemented by java, and then replaced by js (based on express)

files related to front-end are placed in my-app folder.
